## Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/hdemoraes/hospitality-insights.git
cd hospitality-insights

# Create & activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


✅ This ensures anyone who clones the repo can reproduce your environment in one go.

## 🏁 Result  
You now have:  
- a **locked Python environment**,  
- a **requirements file** others can rebuild from,  
- and a **clean GitHub repo** ready for collaboration or deployment.

---

Next step options:  
1. **🚀 Part G — Streamlit UI Starter:** build the minimal web app to visualize notebook results.  
2. **🧠 Part H — RAG Automation Prototype:** connect embeddings + Gemini API for live insights.  

Which direction do you want to go next – UI (front end) or AI (RAG automation)?
